[{"question": "1. The Early Bird\nWhat can be African, Emperor, Little or Macaroni?", "answers": [{"0.7": "The answer is spaghetti.

Where next?\nWhat follows Vienna, Brussels, Prague, Copenhagen, Tallinn, Helsinki, Athens?", "answers": [{"0.7": "The answer is Berlin. This is because all these cities are connected by rail (Vienna -> Brussels -> Prague -> Copenhagen -> Tallinn -> Helsinki -> Athens), and the question asks for the next destination after Athens, which is Berlin."}, {"0.8": "The answer is an alphabet. The reasoning behind this is that after listing these cities in order, you would then list the letters of the alphabet in the same sequence."}, {"1.0": "To solve this question, we need to find a pattern in the cities mentioned.

Therefore, all of their names are missing the letter 'M.'"}, {"0.8": "The answer is John.

The only other option left would be Russia, but even then, you couldn't see the USA from there either. Therefore, Gary must be in Sudan."}, {"1.0": "Gary is in the United States. The reasoning behind this is that if you're looking at a map of the world with your feet touching the four corners (north, east, south and west), it will always point to where you are standing - regardless of which country you're in.

A qeustion to put you to sleep\nFind a whole number which when spelled out has its letters in alphabetical order", "answers": [{"0.7": "The answer is 16807.

This process continues until we reach a single digit:\n16807 = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) - ((1 + 2) * (2 + 3) * (3 + 4) * (4 + 5))\nYou can see that when written as a word, the letters are in alphabetical order: one thousand six hundred eighty seven."}, {"0.8": "The answer is 1096.
