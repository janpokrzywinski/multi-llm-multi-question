The answer to this riddle is not a specific type of bird, but rather words that follow a certain pattern in English language. \nThe words given are African, Emperor, Little, and Macaroni. They all end with the sound \"-an\". When you add the suffix \"-er\" to these words, they change to refer to an individual who is involved in or associated with something. For example:\n- \"African\" becomes \"Africaner\", which refers to something or someone related to Africa.\n- \"Emperor\" becomes \"Emperor\", which refers to a ruler of an empire.\n- \"Little\" becomes \"Littler\", which doesn't have a clear definition but could potentially refer to someone or something small.\n- \"Macaroni\" becomes \"Macaronier\", which was originally a slang term for a fashionable man in the 18th century England, especially one who affected Italian manners and dress.\nTherefore, the answer to this riddle is \"Any word that ends with -an can become an -er to describe someone associated with it\"."}, {"0.8": "The answer is \"Breakfast\".\n\nExplanation:\n\n- African: Certain types of breakfast foods such as plantains or cassava are common in African cuisine.\n- Emperor: In many cultures, including some parts of Africa, a king or ruler would be served breakfast first before anyone else.

This term comes from the Scottish term \"faire way\", meaning a path or route, and it was originally used to describe the shortcuts taken by golfers across fields to reach a golf course. Mushrooms often grow on fairways in golf courses!\n- In website navigation, \"mushroom\" is a common metaphor for a dropdown menu that opens to reveal subcategories when clicked, similar to how a mushroom cap opens up to reveal the stem and gills.\n- Deodorant often includes ingredients like baking soda or activated charcoal which can help absorb moisture and odors, much like how mushrooms absorb nutrients from their environment.\n- In Nintendo's Super Mario series, one of the power-ups that Mario can find is a \"Super Mushroom\", which makes him bigger and allows him to break bricks.\n- Cats love to play with small toys or strings, often batting them around and chasing after them like they're mice. This behavior is reminiscent of how a mouse might try to evade a predator."}, {"1.0": "The answer to this puzzle is \"a mouse.\"\nHere's how each item in the list is linked to a mouse:\n1. A golf course: In a computer game called \"Mario Golf\", one of the main characters is Mario, who is always accompanied by his brother Luigi and their friend Toad. They play golf together. So there's a link between golf courses (where golf is played) and Nintendo characters (like Mario).\n2. Website navigation: The term \"mouse\" is also used as a metaphor for the computer peripheral device that you use to navigate on a website. This device is called a mouse because it looks like the rodent of the same name, with a scroll wheel and buttons. So there's a link between website navigation and the physical object known as a mouse.\n3. Deodorant: In English, there is a famous advertising slogan for a brand of deodorant that says \"I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\" This phrase is associated with the mascot of this brand which is a mouse. So, we have a link between deodorants (which are often used to avoid unwanted odors) and mice (which are known for their tendency to urinate on things they explore).\n4. A Cat: The feline species, often kept as pets or seen in the wild, is well known for its natural hunting instincts which can often lead them to prey on mice. So there's a link between cats (which are common household pets) and mice (their natural prey)."}], "correct_answer": "What links these is 'LINKS', or 'LYNX'"}]
